# Prisoner's Dilemma Mobile App
## Overview
This is the first tier mobile app of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. This is a build up from the Prisoner's Dilemma project I created in just Kotlin to interact with in the terminal.
For now it consists of one page/activity and two buttons. The user has a choice to press a "steal" button or a "split" button. Based off of the opponent's choice (which is 
randomly generated), each player will get some or no money added to their score. The picture below shows the formula behind how much money is given and to whom.

I created this in Andriod Studio using Kotlin and XML. No notable libraries were used.

## Future Work
This is a tier one out of three app. The next steps include selecting the number of rounds to play to, simple animation popups, and two player (on the same device) games. 
The end goal is to create a "Thought Experiment" app that contains this game along with other thought expermiments (including my Trolly Car Ethical Theory Analysis).
